    Are there any illustrations, including drawings, tables, charts, photographs or maps? If yes, select the relevant tab and then draw a box around each illustration and their captions. Mark ‘No’ for pages of text, blank pages, title pages, bookplates, book covers, indexes, tables of content, decorative letters or stamps and advertisements.

                 Next, add information about species in each illustration, by clicking that button and then clicking the centre of each species. If there are multiple species within an image, add information for each one. Don’t worry if you can’t find the common or scientific name, just add what you can. <b>Tip:</b> Use the page link (<span class="fa fa-file"></span>) button to read the original journal. Use the page zoom (<span class="fa fa-search-plus"></span>) button to toggle the full page view.

                 Sometimes people signed their drawings, photographs, charts and maps. Add contributors if you can find them. Look carefully, as they are often small and hard to see!

    content: '''
                 Add keywords to describe each illustration overall and separate each term with semicolons. You can find examples with the Help (<span class="fa fa-question"></span>) button. Keywords can be drawn from the text or be words you would find helpful if searching for images online. Keywords make images more findable.
